Sorts items into folders by subreddit.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n* [Python 2.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\r\n* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)\r\n* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) (recommended)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure you have [Python 2.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your machine.\r\n\r\nRun the following in your command prompt to install:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/csu/export-saved-reddit.git\r\n    cd export-saved-reddit\r\n    pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nTo install without git, [download the source code from GitHub](https://github.com/csu/export-saved-reddit/archive/master.zip), extract the archive, and follow the steps above beginning from the second line.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n1. In the `export-saved-reddit` folder, rename the `AccountDetails.py.example` file to `AccountDetails.py`.\r\n2. Open the `AccountDetails.py` in a text editor and enter your Reddit username and password within the corresponding quotation marks. Save and close the file.\r\n3. Back in your shell, run `python export-saved.py` in the `export-saved-reddit` folder. This will run the export, which will create `chrome-bookmarks.html` and `export-saved.csv` files containing your data in the same folder.\r\n\r\n# Help\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/csu/export-saved-reddit/issues) or [contact me](https://christopher.su/about/).",
